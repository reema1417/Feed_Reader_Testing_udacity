# Project Overview

A Udacity FEND project

This project demonstrates browser based testing using jasmine



## How to will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How to Run?
Open index.html in the browser of your choice. It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made. Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
